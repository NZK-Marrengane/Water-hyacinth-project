# Water-hyacinth-project
 A model which tracks and predicts the location of the water hyacinths on a dam based on weather information

 The model uses 3 months worth of data from both the weather and image capturing. 

 We use sateligt images to get images from the dam and from those images we aquire the location and position data using bounding box methodolgy to do so. 

 We then merge the weather data with the model data and create the model.
